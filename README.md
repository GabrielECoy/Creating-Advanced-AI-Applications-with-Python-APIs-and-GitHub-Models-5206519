## Course Description

GitHub Models lets you build AI features and products that integrate with third-party APIs. In this course, instructor Jonathan Fernandes shows you how to create an AI application using advanced large language model (LLM) tooling and GitHub Models. Experiment with LLM tooling such as function calling to determine the best LLM for the task, and then start designing and building your own prototype. Test out your new skills along the way in the hands-on coding challenges at the end of each section. By the end of this course, youâ€™ll be equipped with the skills you need to create, test, validate, and deploy an AI-powered app that works effectively with a third-party API.
